# Develop Locally

## 1. Dependencies

You will need NodeJs and NPM to build and test local copy of this monorepo.

Clone the repo with git clone https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-wallet-adapter.git
On the root folder, run pnpm install and pnpm turbo run build
On the root folder, run pnpm turbo run dev - that would spin up a local server (localhost:3000) with the nextjs demoapp
