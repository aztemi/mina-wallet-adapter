# Components

This consists of 4 primary components.

## 1. Connect Button

This serves as the entry button to connect a wallet. When clicked, it opens either the Welcome Modal if no wallet is detected or the Select Modal if any wallet is detected. After wallet connection, the button displays the connected account address truncated for the UI (i.e., B62qo7...F5dJSu). Clicking the connected button will present the Dropdown Menu for further options.
